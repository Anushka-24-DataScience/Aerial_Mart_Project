# Aerial_Mart_Project
Steps to Run the Object Detection Project:
Clone the Repository:

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.bash
Copy code
git clone "https://github.com/Anushka-24-DataScience/Aerial_Mart_Project.git"
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Change into the directory of the cloned repository.
bash
Copy code
cd Aerial_Mart_Project
Create and Activate a Conda Environment:

It's a good practice to create a new Conda environment for your project to manage dependencies without conflicts.
bash
Copy code
conda create -n arial python=3.7 -y
conda activate arial
Install the Required Dependencies:

Install all the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can run the app.
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Application in Your Browser:

Once the app is running, open your web browser and navigate to the local host and port provided in the terminal (typically http://localhost:8501 if using Streamlit).
bash
Copy code
http://localhost:8501
Project Structure:
Based on your mention of "Workflows, constants, entity, components, pipelines, app.py," here's a brief overview of how these might fit into the project:

Workflows: Likely contains scripts or YAML files that define the steps of your ML pipeline or CI/CD setup.
Constants: Stores constant values like paths, model parameters, or other settings that don't change frequently.
Entity: Defines data structures or classes that represent different entities in your project (e.g., dataset entities, model entities).
Components: Houses individual modules or components of your project, such as data preprocessing, model training, etc.
Pipelines: Contains the code that orchestrates the entire ML pipeline, from data ingestion to model evaluation.
app.py: The entry point for your application. This script would typically contain the code to launch your web application (in this case, using Streamlit or Flask).
Applying to Your AerialMart Object Detection Project:
If you are adapting this workflow for an AerialMart object detection project using YOLOv5:

Ensure YOLOv5 is Installed:

Make sure YOLOv5 is installed and included in your requirements.txt or manually install it with:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Modify the app.py:(rename the app python file)

Your app.py might need to handle file uploads, invoke the YOLOv5 model for detection, and display results using Streamlit.
Running the App:

Once all necessary components are in place, running python app.py will start the Streamlit app, and you can interact with the detection model through your browser.
